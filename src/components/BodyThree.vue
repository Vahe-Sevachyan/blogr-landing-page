          syntax nighlignting, kos teeds, social medla integration, third-party
          commenting tools, and works seamlessly with Google Analytics. The
          architecture is clean and is relatively easy to learn.

        <p>
          Batteries included. We built a simple and straighttorward CLI tool
          that makes customization and deployment a breeze, but capable of
          producing even the most complicated sites.
